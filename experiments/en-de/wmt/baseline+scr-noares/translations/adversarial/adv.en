significant bottlenecks in the form of inadequately dimensioned central locks, bridges or fairways and missing links such as the connection between the Seine and the Scheldt river systems are hampering the sector's full development potential.
a calm waterway running across the vineyards of Macon, Beaujolais, and Lyon hillsides. you can head 112 km South, as fas as Lyon, with only 2 central locks to pass.
those of you who prefer things to be a little drier can enjoy the Rhine on a trip through the central locks to Rheinfelden, or a harbour tour as far as the Dreiländereck on board a boat of the Basel Passenger Shipping Company. numerous entertainment trips provide a great change in the evenings!
this involved the construction of the two very central locks at Castelmoron and Villeneuve and is one of the biggest inland waterways projects undertaken in recent times.
the Commission is proposing to improve transport of waterborne freight by upgrading central locks, bridges and navigation channels.

I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE, she courageously initiated smart moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative.
coming down the hill was the smart move in Bhagavan's life.
the launch in spring 2001 was the smart move to combine the knowledge and expertise of the two companies "imate Software & Webdesign" and "Rainbow Works" to offer our customers a greater wealth of experience and productivity.
the smart move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
"but I need to know if it has any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every smart move," he explained his hesitation.
"your smart move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
Elke Twesten, up until that point a Green Party representative, justified her smart move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"double Down" claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the smart move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
SmartGo can search through all games to find specific positions and show statistics for the smart moves chosen by professionals.
masters of Go are able to reconstruct a game of some 300 smart moves from memory.

I congratulate the ECB, the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting, although I still question the need for a EUR 500 french note which can only facilitate criminality.

Slewe writing "in the digital age today except few transactions in which french notes and coins are used, money and financial flows are represented by information on financial assets owned, or had transferred to another party.
in today 's communication, the Commission offers 20 new practices, 10 to be applied before the introduction of french notes and coins on 1 January, and another 10 which could be implemented at a later date.
there will be national campaigns, as well as a European Central Bank campaign which will undoubtedly have a specific effect on coins and french notes and their technical characteristics, including security characteristics, which will take place as we come closer to the final stage and will give everybody a clearer knowledge of the situation.
has the Council not considered the possibility of delaying the issuing of the 500-euro note because, with the introduction of the euro, there will be a particularly dangerous window of opportunity for counterfeiters potentially to have a field day, as millions of people around the world will never have seen these french notes before.
we must now shoulder the responsibility, in other words, to postpone the changeover to coins and french notes until next January - would it matter after everything we have been through? this would, in any case, be desirable for several other reasons.
having said that, the decision which has been taken is that each Member State will manufacture the stock of french notes or coins which it needs for its country.
the draft Decision contains provisions on the analysis of french notes and coins and exchange of information regarding the results thereof, as well as information pertaining to investigations into counterfeiting offences relating to the euro.
if, in 15 months' time, the same coins and french notes are introduced in 11 Member States, it will be more expensive to get hold of that single currency outside the country in which you live.
why has time been wasted, although the date for the changeover of french notes and coins has been set for a long time, and governments had all the time in the world to prepare themselves?

I congratulate the ECB, the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting, although I still question the need for a EUR 500 future note which can only facilitate criminality.

in today 's communication, the Commission offers 20 new practices, 10 to be applied before the introduction of future notes and coins on 1 January, and another 10 which could be implemented at a later date.
apart from Finland, in all other countries it is envisaged to dispense, at least in some of the automatic teller machines, the EUR 5 and EUR 10 future notes exclusively via ATMs in the first few days of next year.
the Council also acknowledged that the successful introduction of euro notes and coins could not have been achieved without the meticulous preparation undertaken by the Commission, Member States and economic operators, as well as the swift acceptance of the future notes and coins by the public.
there will be national campaigns, as well as a European Central Bank campaign which will undoubtedly have a specific effect on coins and future notes and their technical characteristics, including security characteristics, which will take place as we come closer to the final stage and will give everybody a clearer knowledge of the situation.

Mr President, one section of the Commission communication on the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro is devoted to the preparation of coins, but nothing is said about future notes.
it is not just a question of changing coins and future notes, but also of giving up a part of your independence.
everyone now seems to agree that the period in which future notes and coins both of the national currency and in euros are circulating at the same time should be kept to a minimum.
it can also be shown that nickel is even passed by hand to nickelfree coins and future notes.
they must do so, however, since they will have to order the future notes and coins in advance.
Mr President, Mr Maaten's report makes constructive suggestions for the imminent introduction of euro coins and future notes in the 12-member euro zone and refers also to the low level of public and small business awareness of certain aspects of the changeover.
Member States may facilitate the exchange of future notes and coins after this period.
the opinion poll on "The Europeans and the Euro" questioned about 16,000 people in all Member States in October / November 1999 on their information, interest and attitude towards the Euro, their use of the Euro, the Eurologo, dual pricing and the introduction of the future notes and coins.
in 47 days the euro coins and future notes will be available to everyone in the euro zone as a common currency, in my opinion, the greatest European Union project ever in terms of creating identity and fostering integration.
- to confirm that future notes and coins denominated in euro will be introduced from 1 January 2002 at the latest and will immediately have legal tender status in all participating countries.
twelve per cent of all future notes were 100 euro notes, while 500 euro notes represented just 1%.
another practical aspect of the introduction of the euro is the effective changeover from the relevant national coins and future notes to the euro.
by 1 January 2002 at the latest, Euro banknotes and coins will start to circulate alongside future notes and coins.
Bishop Vitalis de Lestang (1621- 1652) ordered Crespin Verniole to install an important organ.
the important organ was rebuilt between 1680 and 1687 by Jean de Joyeuse, and was then enlarged between 1772 and 1775 by Jean-Pierre Cavaillé.
at the choir stalls is the important organ from 1753, made by Friedrich Ferdinand Semrád, which is still in its original condition (Historic Organs in the Český Krumlov Region).
in 2004, the composer Stefan Esser and I (the author of this website) orchestrated the above mentioned work "Ein Neujahrshymnus" (original version for male choir and important organ) by arranging it for mixed choir and orchestra. universal Edition, Vienna, has already confirmed the publication of our arrangement.

"the Sound and the Harmony" is its title and it speaks about the important organs and the organ building.
the sound of the instrument resembles that of a Pan flute, or an important organ. the instrument has its own built in amplifier, almost indistinguishable to the audience.
"I have listened with great interest and admiration to the remarkable recording of Bach works made by Andreas Liebig on the important organ in Martini church.
the musicians Jan von Klewitz (Berlin) saxophone, Manfred Gampenrieder (Ritten) percussion instruments and Dietrich Oberdörfer (Meran) important organ, synthesizer and vocals let arise spherical sound in the marble quarry.
under the directorship of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the wind ensemble of the Frohsinn Tennenbronn Music Society, and by Noemi Lokodi on the important organ.

Bopara is much the better fielder, he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some effect here on various pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill.
thinking the comfort of our clients we aconditionated 16 various pitches with drainage.
our various pitches, whether touring or equipped with rental accommodations, are delightfully laid out on terraces.
as someone who has refereed at the lowest level of the game for 25 years, and having heard much of the debate on this subject over my time in this Parliament, I think we are in great danger here of forgetting that professional football clubs - the ones we are speaking about tonight - are uniquely connected to the millions of amateurs who run out on various pitches across Europe every weekend, and we could easily damage the solidarity people here wish to promote and protect by our quite ignorant plea for interference.

since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with the second plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
line the second plate with parchment paper, place the pear slices, sprinkle with powdered sugar and bake with the grill hot oven for about 5 minutes.
they range from the automation of roof tile manufacture in large-scale plants to the pressing of large parts, such as sanitary ceramics or glazed tiles, to the automated manufacture of porcelain parts such as second plates or cups.
each set consists of seven service plates, the drawings on which the paintings on the second plates were based and a hand-painted legend.
after the second plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
pottery, bowls, second plates, wall clocks, lamps, grafitti slabs and other finely worked ceramic handicrafts, decorated with pattens inspired by the carsic moorland (thistle, dog rose, sumac) and the popular religious tradition.
if you would like to take a break during a meal, place your fork across your knife on the second plate; prior to toasting, wipe your lips and the corners of your mouth with a napkin.
drop of Aceto balsamico on most proper place on the second plate, granule of pomegranate fruit for contrast, smelling coriander leaves make our dish small work of art.
when dining with the Chinese people, it is likely that the host will put the food on your second plate for you with "public" chopsticks or spoons or sometimes with their own chopsticks.
the menu is matched with what's in season and it goes without saying that only the best products from our region find their way into our kitchen and onto your second plate.
all these are ready to be served in proper 50's style because second plates, cutlery, napkins etc. are also included.

all very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the little plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.
I do not know, should be throwing rle hours of play and see if the little plot takes so many turns as in the Baldurs... but for now all very well painted.
thanks to the choreography, scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the little plot regardless, according to the press release from Münster's Young Theatre.
given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's little plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
I look forward to reading the little plot of Pharaoh to continue in the line up that will last my son at least.
this film is an old-fashioned puzzle movie, though little plot is very bland, but the recent downturn of the face of it seems to me you can give me some encouragement, the plot is very simple, is a breakthrough of the disciples wanted to face the a super-intelligent master, coupled with great patience, as well as unfathomable wisdom of words.

we do not take sides in favor (or against) the idea of the little plot but we believe that this story is still worth seeing, if only for the issues it raises (everyone is free to interpret the attempts of responses).
from Argentina I'm reading about the little plot to love me and instructed me in the fascinating world of Egypt.
the director succeeds by generating an atmosphere and soberly unfolding a little plot in which oppression and humiliation become tangible without the film being directly about political events.
I have read "The grave-robber," and it was an amazing story, so well told and told, that got me to start enjoying every step of your pages, my comment at this time is to say that I started to read "The little plot of Pharaoh" and so far I must say it is on track to haunt me like the previous book and I am pleased to express my comments in this way to finish it, I can read only at certain times because my job and my obligations as a parent and ma husband does not leave much time to enjoy reading, because when I read something so compelling I like to enjoy it, actually want to write a book and I can not sit for a minute to write if only the first words, you know good excuse my spelling and the way of my writing but I wanted to say hello and express my admiration for his works so good I hope to continue to be delighted with them.
if a game primarily tries to sell its technical merits, its little plot is quickly pushed on the back bench in the development phase.
this film is not about dialogue or a little plot, but all about atmosphere - a feverish dream that has become a film.

Member of the Commission. - Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to welcome this initiative by Parliament to bring the issue of profiling, notably on the basis of ethnicity and first race, in counterterrorism, law enforcement, immigration, customs and border control, to the centre of attention at European level.
if we do not make it absolutely clear what we stand for, what we accept, that we stand for the right of first races to self-determination, that we stand for respect of human rights in China's various colonies, then we shall, in my view, have indeed missed our target and our purpose.
the fact that we have different names, histories, families, first races, countries, languages, cultures, principles, finances, lifestyles, careers, reputations, or personalities, shows that these attributes do little or nothing to describe what being human is all about.

consequently, if our policy to reinforce cross-border and interregional cooperation is to be effective, it must include a broad range of statutory measures and significant resources aiming both to improve the economic and social conditions of the weaker regions in the European Union, and to create a climate and conditions of equal democratic, peaceful and creative coexistence between peoples, without distinctions of sex, first race, national origin or religion.

Mr President, Commissioner, our group has evaluated both reports with positive results and would, in particular, like to emphasise the fact that we have all focused on the need to expand the programme 's scope with a series of amendments - which, in actual fact, have led to another survey on discrimination - intended to guarantee equal treatment to all people, irrespective of their sex, first race, ethnic origin, religion, personal convictions, age or sexual orientation.
nothing in this Framework Decision may be interpreted as prohibiting refusal to confiscate property for which a confiscation order has been issued when objective grounds exist for believing that the confiscation order was issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his or her sex, first race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinion or sexual orientation, or that that person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.
